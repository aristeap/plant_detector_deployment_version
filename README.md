## Introduction
The Plant Detector is a full-stack web application designed to accurately identify plants from user-uploaded images. This project showcases a modern, responsive web interface built with **React** on the frontend and a robust **API-driven** backend powered by **PHP**. 

### ðŸŒ¸ Key Features
* **Image-Based Plant Identification**: Users can upload a photo of a plant to receive a detailed identification, including its common and scientific names, along with crucial care information (watering, sunlight, pruning).

* **Intelligent Caching with Relational Database**: A custom relational database stores previously identified plant data and user queries, significantly reducing redundant API calls and speeding up subsequent identifications. (*under-development*)

* **API Integration**: The application seamlessly integrates with external APIs such as PlantNet for advanced plant recognition and Perenual for gardening plant data.

* **User Authentication & History**: Future enhancements will include user login/signup functionality, enabling personalized features like storing a user's plant identification history. (*under-development*)

* **Community Engagement**: Dedicated features for User Comments and Related Articles will allow users to share insights, discuss plants, and contribute knowledge to the community. (*under-development*)

* **Rich Visual Content**: The "More Images" feature will empower users to upload and view additional images for specific plants, creating a more comprehensive visual database. (*under-development*)

## Deployment & Live Demo
Secure & Scalable Architecture: The frontend is hosted on Netlify, while the PHP backend is deployed as a containerized service on Render, ensuring a reliable and scalable architecture.

Efficient Deployment Pipeline: The project utilizes a CI/CD pipeline with GitHub for version control, allowing for automated builds and deployments on both platforms.
